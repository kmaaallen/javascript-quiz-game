This is a simple javaScript multiple choice quiz on identifying birds native to New Zealand.

## UX
This game is for anybody who wants to test their knowledge of New Zealand native birds.
It aims to provide a picture of a bird and four options for users to choose from.

1) As a quizzer I want to choose from a range of answers and get a score at the end.
2) When I answer a question, I want to see if I answered correctly or not.

During project development I created some basic wireframes for my project. 
<br> These can be viewed under: 

## Features
### Existing Features
#### Feature 1 - Start button
The start button allows users to start the quiz from the home page by clicking on it.

#### Feature 2 - Question and answer set up
Once the quiz has been started, each question/answers screen has the same format.
A question at the top, and four buttons underneath labelledd with different answers for the user to choose from.
Once a user makes a button choice and clicks on it, the next question/answers set is displayed.
HOWEVER, if it is the last question in the quiz the score page is displayed instead upon user clicking button.

#### Feature 3 - Score page
The user's score is displayed.

### Features Left to Implement
#### Feature 1 - Hint button for extra clues.
Users recieve an alert with an extra hint before they make their choice.
If the hint button is activated, users recieve only half a point if then answered correctly.
